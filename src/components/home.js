    <p className="skybio"> Hi, I’m Coach Sky! I’m a Triathlon and Run Coach based out of Spokane, WA/Coeur D’Alene, ID and coach virtually across the world.

I am an Ironman Certified Coach, NASM Certified Personal Trainer, Certified Nutrition Coach with a Weight Loss Specialization.

I am a lifelong swimmer with a love for adventurous racing. My race history is diverse, ranging from ITU World Championships and Team USA, 50 mile ultras, Ragnar Ultras and long distance open water swims. I enjoy the challenge of trying new distances and terrains, always learning and growing in the joy of racing.

When I’m not coaching or training myself, you’ll find me dreaming up cycling inventions and trying to turn my fluffy, loopy doodles into dignified runners.</p>
